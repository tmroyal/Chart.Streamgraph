# Chart.Streamgraph.js
Streamgraph library and plug-in using Chart.js.

This plug-in uses [chart.js](http://chartjs.org) to enable the creation of [Streamgraphs](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/). Invented by [Lee Byron](http://leebyron.com) and [Martin Wattenberg](http://www.bewitched.com/), Streamgraphs are similar to stacked area charts with the exception that data regions do not overlap. Rather, Streamgraph regions are placed on top of one another, creating a shape that highlights the aggregate sum of all data points. While Streamgraphs do not present data with utmost clarity, they can be a cool way to present time-evolving data sets (for example).
